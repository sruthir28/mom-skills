When creating a weekly report:

## Format
Use this structure:

### Week of [Date Range]

**Key Accomplishments**
- List 3-5 main things completed
- Focus on outcomes, not activities

**In Progress**
- What's actively being worked on
- Include % complete if known

**Blockers/Risks**
- Anything slowing progress
- What help is needed

**Next Week Priorities**
- Top 3 focus areas
- Any important deadlines

## Style Guidelines
- Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines max)
- Use action verbs (Launched, Completed, Resolved)
- Quantify when possible (e.g., "Reduced by 20%")
- Professional but not overly formal tone

## If Given Raw Notes
- Extract the most important items
- Group related items together
- Remove duplicates and filler
- Ask clarifying questions if context is unclear
